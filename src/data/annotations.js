      "Curtis Quam, a representative of the Zuni peoples, shared his personal handwritten annotations of this image titled Zuni Eagle Cage. They are a powerful interpretation of what was captured by John K. Hillers.",
      "Eagles are considered to be sacred in Zuni culture and traditions, and for centuries they were kept in small aviaries and cages by elders. Their feathers were gathered by the Zuni for ceremonial purposes, and they continue to be a sacred item in their spiritual traditions."

      "text": "The head scarf, during this time period, it was normal with people that we see. It could signify that this person had a religious leader role within a community. Today, normally, we see them in a different way. It's still a head scarf and usually a bow on one side, and that kind of signifies that during ceremonies that there's a position or some participation with the ceremonies that are going on. One of the biggest things for us is like wondering if these head scarves were more functional during that time. So it's really interesting to have this conversation about that for us too."

      "text": "One thing I did not note was that the earrings that actually also signifies a really important part for men is to have our ears pierced. To wear earrings. And that was an important thing. And the necklace, from what we can see from photos, and just memories of our elders, is that this was just everyday wear for a lot of people. That this was a really important, not only jewelry and fashion statement, but also we've heard through some scholars that turquoise is partly made up from water. And a lot of what we're wearing is actually what we're praying for, is rainwater in order for things to grow."

      "text": "On the bottom, the woven leggings were traditional, almost like socks, but they didn't cover the feet. It was just for what we would call shins today in that area, and it was just traditional leggings during that time for men and women. There's a slit in the pants that's kind of like the traditional Zuni pants style."

      "coords": [0.935, 0.713],
      "text": "Notice there's a lava stone that's propped up against it. This could have a little more, of course, probably weight to keep the fencing up for the cage. But it's one of those really interesting things that kind of point out to me that there was a Lava stone there."

      "text": "The perch was interesting. A lot of those perches actually you can see also in places like Mesa Verde, Chaco Canyon, where they possibly had birds also within the community. So it could be a cage. It could be a larger aviary. But we've seen some of those in some of those ancestral sites as well, so the perch is really important for the bird to be around."

      "name": "Golden Eagle/Boshkwa",
      "coords": [0.781, 0.215],
      "text": "I did note that it's possibly tethered. As you can see, there is a wing feather that is out of place. So that could be a point where they tethered the bird for a while, and they fed and took care of the bird until the bird actually felt safe and stayed within that area and grew that companionship. So I noticed that from there, I noted it is a golden eagle, and in Zuni we call golden eagles Boshkwa. Or they could just be called commonly k'yak'yali, which is an eagle. But specifically for a golden eagle it's Boshkwa."

And I've seen that within photos, not all the time, but it's really where the light was probably good for the camera, and I'm assuming that. So that's a really interesting note within historical photos as well."

That's the really cool thing, so hopefully, I'm just starting a really good conversation with other people that can either confirm or just add to what I said. And that's like the intention I think for us is to just keep adding to the community and yeah, so this is kind of what I see. There's more, but that's what I think, without making it overwhelming and also going into other details, a good way to start off."
